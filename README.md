# This is my Emacs setup

The base of the setup was forked from the Brave Clojure suggested one. I expanded it with several fun packages (multiple-cursors, expand-region etc) and support for Python and R.

## R

Only some minor changes to the default ESS setup

## Rmarkdown.el

I wrote several functions to work with Rmarkdown, extending the support already existing in polymode

## Python

Using Elpy
